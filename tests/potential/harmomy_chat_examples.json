Hence they can produce factual errors or wishful “hallucinations.” |\n| **Heavy reliance on training data** | Skills and knowledge are tightly coupled to the content of the corpora they were trained on. They can’t extrapolate beyond that data, and the longer the prompt, the more likely they drift or over‑generalize. |\n| **Bias & toxicity** | Languag­e corpora contain societal bias; without careful filtering, the model proliferates and amplifies stereotypes or harmful viewpoints. |\n| **Non‑spatial be‑haviour constraints** |",
