GenLM Control is a library for controlled generation with programmable constraints. It leverages sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods to efficiently generate text that satisfies constraints or preferences encoded by arbitrary potential functions. See the [docs](https://genlm.github.io/genlm-control/) for details and [examples](https://github.com/genlm/genlm-control/tree/main/examples/getting_started.py) for usage.



## Quick Start

TODO: This library supports installation via pip:
